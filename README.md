# FrostGameEngine

Welcome to the Frost Game Engine source  code!

From this repository, you can build the Frost editor for Windows in the future.

Now, I only finish the design of the DirectX12 rendering dynamic library.If you are ready to learn DirectX12, you can download this. 

I will update the content frequently untill the Frost Game Engine is completed. 

### Getting up and running
The steps below will take you through cloning your own private fork, then compiling and running the editor yourself:
### Windows 
 1. Install GitHub for Windows then fork and clone my repository. 
    If you'd prefer not to use Git, you can get the source with the 'Download ZIP' button 	    on the right.
 2. Install Visual Studio 2017 and "Desktop development using C++" components in       		Visual Stuadio.
 3. Check if the GPU driver supports DirectX12 and the system is Windows10.

### Reference
The DirectX12 rendering dynamic library is based on the rendering daynamic library in CRY ENGINE. Thank you for CRY ENGINE open source code. If you want to understand the powerful game engine, you can focus on CRY ENGINE open source code.

### Additional Notes
The first time you start the FrostRenderDll or Sampler, you may modify include directory and reference directory in order to ensure compiling and  running.
